WCF-Service-ToDO-APP
====================
Simple WCF Service for my Windows Phone ToDO App (it si a learning project).
Service is prepare for IIS hosting. I had some problems with self hosting then i choose for IIS hosting. 
Service use TransportWithMessageCredential secutity mode. For that you need sll certificate. 
I use self sign certificate. Common name of certicicate must be server name. 
Then you transfer via (Dropbox.. ) your certificate to your Windows Phone emulator. 

I will  describe more in future.....
